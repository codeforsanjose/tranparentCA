# About the TransparentCA Project

Transparent California (http://transparentcalifornia.com/) provides compensation of public workers within the state (county/city/state/school districts/etc). It can also export data in CSV file. While the site contains a nice search engine, it lacks any analytic ability. The goal of this project is provide tools for normalization and analysis of this data, like comparision the salary of a given position among different cities (average, increase, bonus), highlight deviation such as abnormal increase/bonus/overtime.

The additional outcome of this project will be the database with normalized data and some scripts for data manipulation.
